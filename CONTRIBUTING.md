# Contributing

This document describes some processes and guidelines we follow and will help make the contribution process as smooth as possible! ‚ú®

---

## 1) One change per PR

Keeping PRs focused on a single change makes them easier (and faster) to review. We may ask you to split up a large PR if it includes many unrelated changes.

## 2) Fill out the PR description

The more context you can provide in the PR description, the better equipped we will be to review it.
This will make reviews more effective and faster. üöÄ

You can also add inline comments on your own PR to add some context or point our areas you want your reviewers to focus on.

## 3) Once a PR is approved, you are responsible for merging your PR

Unless otherwise arranged, we will never merge your PRs. It's your code and you know best when it's ready to be merged.

## 4) We strive to at least respond to review requests within 24 hours

In general, we will review and approve/leave feedback on your PR within 24 hours, but in some cases we may not be able to dedicate the time necessary to give it a thorough review. Feel free to ping us if you see PRs go stale.

## 5) Add a release label on the PR

The changes in your PR will lead to a release of the changes. Assign the PR either a `patch`, `minor` or `major` label according to the changes made in the PR.
